<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">Within Higher Education (HE), critical thinking is seen as a measure of students’ intellectual development. However, there is debate about what critical thinking is, especially, because it can differ based on subject and the educator’s understanding of the concept. For example, the authors ask whether “learning outcome about critical thinking [is] a matter of emancipatory empowerment or a matter of scientific reasonings? Is… [it] about finding a basis for reliable judgements or about forming a sceptical position?” (p. 2298). These differences in understanding, then, have implications in terms of measuring ‘critical thinking’ via learning outcomes.</p>
<p class="pad">While clearly defined learning outcomes helps foster confidence among parents and students and increases transparency in the education sector, the authors urge readers to consider the complication of higher education goals that cannot be expressed as learning outcomes. This happen when learning cannot be formalized and/or measured. For example, life-long interest in learning is attributed to critical thinking, but educators cannot measure it within a classroom and within a semester. However, at the same time, if none of the learning outcomes are related to critical thinking, then the focus of critical thinking within the classroom may change which could impede development of the skill.</p>
<p class="pad">Learning outcomes can also be a ceiling for student ambitions. When all learning outcomes are clearly defined, student learning and growth can be limited because there is no incentive for them to try to go further. At the same time, teachers have no way of rewarding the students who do go further.</p>
<p class="pad">That is not to say that learning outcomes are bad. To enhance student learning and fully capitalize on using learning outcomes related to critical thinking, educators must regularly discuss the different aspects of the skills and have the responsibility and freedom to add to the process as individual experts.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">My labmates/fellow TAs and I used to discuss the strict rubrics that we were given. Students who were focused on getting good grades tended to follow the rubric to the letter. This, generally, meant that students that followed the rubric got good marks. Students who were able to suss out what information is actual important did not follow the rubric… and so, better thinkers were punished with lower grades, while students who were just following the formula were rewarded with higher grades. This, I think, is ludicrous! I didn’t have a rubric that I could refer to when completing my assignment, and so I learned to differentiate between important and non-important information.</p>
<p class="pad">By giving students a full detailed rubric based on rigid learning outcomes, we are stripping away their autonomy and limiting their learning. That’s not to say that all rubrics are bad. Rubrics can create a standard that you can assess all student by and so, I can see its value. However, when you have a detailed rubric, you are following the formula—there is very little thinking involved. Did they hit the mark? If yes, they get a point; if no, they don’t get a point. It really is that simple. …But, I value self-learning, and I am a proponent of critical thinking (scientific reasoning type of critical thinking that encourages students to form reliable judgements), so I would rather do away with detailed rubrics and learning outcomes and have more descriptive rubrics that just say “excellent use of evidence for argument”. What does it mean? You need to engage with the rubric—what is ‘excellent use’? what is ‘evidence’? what is your ‘argument’?</p>
<p class="pad">I don’t know what the best approach would be. These are some of my thoughts based on my values, biases and expectations of what Higher Education is supposed to mean for an individual.</p>
