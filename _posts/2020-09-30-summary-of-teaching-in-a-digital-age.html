<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">The authors conducted focus group discussions and held interviews with teachers and administrators in seven schools that have integrated technology into their teaching practices. They also observed classroom interactions. The researchers found that technology had five roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="pad"><strong>Increased access.</strong> Technology improves access to learning resources and materials. Teachers can access a variety of online resources by using flipped and blended learning models; at the same time, students can navigate these online resources at their own pace, based on their learning needs and/or the learning format. As such, students can come to class prepared and get the support they need in class. Technology also increases student accountability for completing assignments. </li>
	<li class="pad"><strong>Greater reach.</strong> Students are actively engaged in researching information, rather than waiting for answers from teachers. Students develop questioning, research and critical thinking skills because they can construct their own learning. With technology, students have access to the ‘latest’ information and aren’t limited to textbook information. Students could, also, collaborate with others across schools, districts, countries and even continents. </li>
	<li class="pad"><strong>Teacher’s time.</strong> Teachers can provide immediate feedback, such that they can focus on providing relevant support to students, rather than on content delivery and grading.</li>
	<li class="pad"><strong>Teacher-student roles.</strong> Teachers take on the role of guiding and facilitating—rather than dictating—student learning. Teachers need to guide students how to find and identify relevant information, and to evaluate the quality and validity of sources; students need to learn how to question their knowledge and engage in critical thinking. In doing so, students can achieve a deeper understanding of the topic. The classroom moves from being ‘teacher-centered’ to ‘learner-centered’.</li>
	<li class="pad"><strong>Communication and feedback.</strong> Enhances communication between students and teachers for efficient feedback and adjustment of teaching practices. Furthermore, collaboration could be easier since communication between group members can take place anytime. Technology (blogs, discussion forums among other) helps build social interactions amongst learners. Finally, games and in-class polls can be used to evaluate student understanding and, thus, the teaching focus for the day.</li>
</ul>
<p class="pad">The authors also stress on the importance of context—ie., teacher empowerment and teacher-driven professional development trainings on use of technology. Furthermore, technology infrastructure, teacher support and large-scale technology integration within the school are also important. </p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">When I was working as a Teaching Assistant, I discussed some of these ideas with my colleagues. I was not a good student in middle and early high school. Students were still expected to memorize and regurgitate information back then. In fact, in the Nepali eight-grade board exam, my average score was 78%. My mother cried because it was the highest grade I had ever gotten, and she had been expecting me to fail. I was not a good student.</p>
<p class="pad">But then, I moved schools in 10th grade (age 16), and we started using online resources. The focus of my education went from memorizing facts to discovering and learning patterns. I started doing better. It’s not because, suddenly, at 16 my brain just switched on; it’s because the focus moved from surface learning to deep learning. I learned how to find information, evaluate it and synthesize it with all the other bits of information I had (prior knowledge). I was also able to choose a topic within the course for further research as part of our final paper/project. This increased my motivation. This is a personal reflection, but it illustrates how different people have different ways of (and motivations for) learning; using online resources and tools can allow students to learn at their own pace and in their own ways.</p>
<p class="pad">These days there is no shortage of information available online. I think that the focus of teaching needs to shift from rote memorization and regurgitation to application and deeper learning. This also teaches students skills that would be valuable in the current and future workplace such as critical thinking, researching, and problem solving. Furthermore, increasing access to education allows a larger number of people to develop these skills. I also think that our format of assessment needs to change to accommodate the changing teaching practices, but that is a topic for a different day.</p>
