<h3>Article Summary:</h3>
	<p class="pad">The author studied 89 marked bighorn sheep ewes that were at least 2 years of age (the earliest that the ewes give birth) for eight years in Southwestern Alberta. He estimated the minimum age of ewes that were older than lambs or yearlings based on their horn annuli (grooves in horns as a result of horn growth each year).  The study was a mixture of observations (of the ewes and their lambs to look for pregnancy, lactation, and sex of the lamb) and lab work (Baermann technique was used to conduct lungworm larval counts from ewes’ feces). Feces from each ewe was collected between 2 to 9 times each year. </p>
	<p class="pad">Non-lactating ewes had lower larval counts compared to lactating ewes. Larval counts were not different between ewes that gave birth to sons (males) or daughters (females). However, compared to ewes who had given birth to females, ewes who had given birth to males the previous year had a higher larval count. During the 1985-86 pneumonia epizootic (disease that is widespread in an animal population), ewes who had lactated when they were two years of age were more likely to die, compared to ewes who did not lactate that early. </p>
	<p class="pad">Intriguingly, although ewes gave birth to females in consecutive years, they tended not to give birth to males in consecutive years. Finally, ewes who lactated at 2 years of age were more likely to lactate in consecutive years, compared to ewes who did not lactate that early. </p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
	<p class="pad">Fascinating study, isn’t it? There is so much to unpack here. For example, lactating ewes had a higher larval count – is that the cost of reproduction? For the mother, there is a trade-off between investing in immune function and reproduction. This is because there is a finite amount of energy that an individual can access. So, it would make sense that when you are actively trying to reproduce (i.e., pregnant, or lactating), you may divert resources from immune function to reproduction; however, when you aren’t actively trying to reproduce (the rest of the year), you could increase investment into immune function.</p>
	<p class="pad">I also think it’s fascinating that the larval counts were the same for mothers the year they gave birth regardless of the sex of their lamb. However, the following year, mothers who gave birth to sons had a higher larval count! If only I had all the time and money in the world to conduct more research! Over the years, more studies have hinted at the idea that male offspring are more costly to the mother, than female offspring. I would love to investigate that further. I don’t know too much about it yet, so I can’t really say anything, but I do have a few questions. For example, what is the annual patterns of parasite infections in females? Is there an overall pattern – such that during late gestation, birthing and lactation, female parasite egg counts increase, but over the next few months, parasite egg counts decrease? If there are multi-year patterns, what are they? Do females who gave birth to males have a higher larval count compared to females who gave birth to females? Did females who gave birth in consecutive years have a higher larval count, compared to females who gave birth every alternate year? Why do some females give birth in consecutive years, and others every alternate year? </p>
	<p class="pad">Those are just a few questions – the more you read, the more specific your questions can be. Don’t read to accept; read to question and learn.</p>
