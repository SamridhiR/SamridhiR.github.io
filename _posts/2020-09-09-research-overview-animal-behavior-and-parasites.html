<p class="pad">A young ranger was explaining how he tracked tigers. In the middle of a sentence, he bent down so I could only see a part of him on-screen. My eyes were glued to the T.V.—why did documentaries do this? What did he find off-screen?</p>
<p class="pad">He turned around and showed me what he had picked up–tiger poo. I lost interest. As a 10-year old, I remember thinking ‘well, that’s one thing I will never do!’ Fast-forward about 15 years, and here I am, a recent master’s degree graduate with three years of experience collecting and analysing bighorn sheep poo. (Life lesson: Never say never!)</p>
<p class="pad">Poo, or feces, is fascinating. Not only can the freshness indicate how long ago an individual may have passed by, but, if you analyse the feces under a microscope, you can learn what individuals eat and what gastrointestinal parasites they may have. I was interested in the latter. I wanted to investigate the patterns of parasite infections in bighorn sheep and whether these patterns affected how much time an individual devoted to different activities.</p>
<p class="pad">So, I collected fresh bighorn sheep poo, by observing them going about their daily business (and recording it) and making note of all the places that each individual could have defecated. After the sheep left the area, either my assistant or I went to collect the feces. If it was easy to squish the poo pellets between our fingers, we knew that it was fresh, and so, we collected it. It wasn’t too bad – we wore gloves… except when we forgot to.</p>
<p class="pad">After we collected the feces, we analysed the samples. Well, my amazing assistants processed the samples and I counted the number of parasite eggs in each microscope slide (and, therefore, in each individual) (Figure 1).</p>

<p class="pad">After a couple of years of doing this, I finally had answers for my questions:</p>
<ol class="pad">
	<li class="pad">Does season affect the number of parasite eggs that an individual shed in their feces? (<strong>spoiler alert</strong>: It does… but the parasite matters as well)</li> 
	<li class="pad">Does the sex of the infected individual affect the number of parasites eggs that an individual shed in their feces? (<strong>spoiler alert</strong>: Yes! And so, does the season. The relationship between season and host-sex on parasite egg count is fascinating!)</li> 
	<li class="pad">Does the parasite egg count affect how much time an individual devoted to different activities? (<strong>spoiler alert</strong>: Meh, not really)</li>
