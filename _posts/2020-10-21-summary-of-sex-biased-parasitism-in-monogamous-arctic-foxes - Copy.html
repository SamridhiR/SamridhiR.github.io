<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">The authors worked with local trappers to obtain arctic fox carcasses around the West Coast of the Hudson Bay. They conducted necropsies on 52 carcasses between 2011 and 2012 to determine the endoparasites present. Adults and subadult were identified based on their canine teeth x-rays. The authors dissected the stomachs and other organs to check for parasite intensity and abundance. Finally, because the stable isotope ratio of the prey is transferred to the fox when they eat their prey, the authors used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in fox muscle samples to analyse the foxes’ diet.</p>
<p class="pad">In terms of parasities they found:</p>
<ul class="pad">
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p class="pad">In terms of diet they found:</p>
<ul class="pad">
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p class="pad">The authors attribute the difference in parasite load to differences in diet.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">Because this study was published relatively close to the time when I was deciding on my research questions, it had an impact on determining my questions. This is a fascinating research because it shows how slight differences in behavior and food preferences could impact parasite abundance in individuals. Bighorn sheep, for example, tend to stay in sex segregated groups (I say, sex-segregated, but, they have two main groups: 1) nursery groups which consist of females and their lambs/yearlings and 2) bachelor groups which consist of juvenile and adult males). These groups come together during mating season (late November/December in my field site) but otherwise tend to stay apart from one another even within the same locality. What would the impact of this segregation be, in terms of parasite infection intensity, abundance and prevalence?</p>
<p class="pad">It would also be interesting to study whether a potential sex bias in food could be related to the costs of investing in immune function vs reproduction for the females.</p>
<p class="pad">Finally, I understand the constraints of time during research; however, it would have been amazing if the authors had conducted the isotope study in the prey populations within this. The reason being that other studies had shown that male and female diet is largely the same. In this study population, however, the male and female diet differed based on <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C values. It makes me question the applicability of stable isotope ratio values when I do not know if that is reflected in this prey population as well. The fact that the authors do note that and explicitly state that it needs to be studied is good since it shows that they are aware that their findings raise questions (they’re researchers, of course they’re aware, but still). But it doesn’t solve the problem.</p>
