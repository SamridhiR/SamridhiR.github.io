<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">The authors were curious about whether reproductive effort was correlated to lungworm larvae fecal output in bighorn sheep. To sate their curiosity, they determined maternity by observing ewes with their lambs, from 2000-2003 at Sheep River Provincial Park, over spring and summer. They also observed the males during pre-rut to determine their social rank. During the rutting season, the authors located and observed all the rams in the park and determined their behavior—searching for ewes, coursing or tending. For the lungworm larval counts, the authors collected fecal samples from known individuals (rams and ewes) each month. Finally, they also analysed the testosterone concentrations in fecal samples that were collected from rams during pre-rut and rut (September to December).</p>
<p class="pad">All 104 sheep aged, at least, one year and all 48 lambs had lungworm larvae in their feces. Overall, in spring, female count was higher than male count, but, in early winter, male count was higher than female count. Both sexes had comparatively low counts in summer.</p>
<p class="pad">Pregnant and lactating ewes had a higher lungworm larvae fecal output, compared to yeld ewes. While rams who spent more time searching for estrous females shed more lungworm larvae, the amount of time that the rams spent either tending or coursing (mating strategies) was not correlated to fecal lungworm larvae output. Finally, the authors also found that testosterone concentrations were not correlated to lungworm larvae output during the pre-rut.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">This was one of the papers that convinced me, much to my later regret (not really :D), that I should embark on a journey to collect data for the entire year, rather than focusing on a specific season as most studies tend to. Getting data for the entire year would mean that I could investigate monthly and seasonal changes in the fecal output of all gastrointestinal parasites that I was investigating. Further, I decided, what I should do is try to collect at least two fecal samples each month for every individual. At least, I would try to collect fecal samples from every individual every week, but failing that, my self-declared minimum was to collect fecal samples from every individual at least every alternate week.</p>
<p class="pad">Ugh, yea, what was I thinking? ‘DATA! I want more data!’ That was pretty much all I was considering at that time. And late spring, summer and early fall were absolutely wonderful! I went out there with my assistant and/or a volunteer and we watched sheep for hours, observing their behavior, and towards the end of the day, collecting fecal samples in individually labeled bags. Ah, those were good days. But, when early fall bled into late fall… and it started snowing, and the temperatures dropped by 20 degrees in less than a week… I regretted my ambition and I regretted my decision—my supervisor had asked me repeatedly if I was sure I wanted to do that, and I had confirmed that, ‘yes, of course, professor, I want more data, what’s a little cold weather?’</p>
<p class="pad">Every time that I had to shift positions because one part of my body seemed to be going numb while sitting on snow to observe the sheep, I regretted my decision… and like magic, every spring and summer, I forgot all about my winter experiences. I looked forward to going to the field again. Field life is amazing.</p>
<p class="pad">Yes, this ‘reflection’ is just wholly about me reflecting on my data-related decision-making skills! I might update this later, so that it is more relevant. </p>
