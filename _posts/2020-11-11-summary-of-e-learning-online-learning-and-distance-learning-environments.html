<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">For the first half of the paper, the authors discuss how different researchers in education have different understanding of the concepts of ‘e-learning’, ‘online learning’ and ‘distance learning’. They mention how researchers disagree about whether ‘e-learning’ is limited to web-based, web-capable, and web-distributed mediums (learning via the internet, the intranet and CD-ROM), or whether it also includes audio- and videotape, interactive TV and satellite broadcast. Similarly, should ‘online learning’ be one that uses some type of technology in its delivery or is it one that enhances student flexibility, student-instructor connectivity and can promote varied interactions? Is ‘distance learning’ defined by the instruction materials regardless of instructor and learner locations, or is it defined by the physical distance between an instructor and their learners, and the instructors’ ability to provide instruction at disparate times via technology?</p>
<p class="pad">To understand how these words are understood, the researchers recruited survey participants during a 2009 educational technology conference. Based on the survey results, some participants did not think there was a difference between the terms. However, when participants thought that there was a difference, they categorized the differences to: ‘hierarchical organization’; ‘media type’; ‘interaction type’; ‘correspondence’ and; ‘access type’.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">The premise of this article sounded interesting. It was a relatively easy read (although, there were a few clumsy and jargon-heavy sentences). Anyway, it did not deliver. Based on the title, I was expecting a review (or a meta-analysis) of papers that used these three terminologies and, basically, a comparison of how the three terms were being used. But, the second half of the paper just reported what some people at a conference said/thought. That’s not a bad start. But I was expecting the discussion (at least!) to tackle the issue—so, what are the differences and similarities between the terminologies? How are/were the differences and similarities categorised? How would the authors recommend categorising the differences and similarities?</p>
<p class="pad">I had additional questions. What percentage of their sample population thought the differences were based on type of media used to deliver content, or the type of interaction between instructors and learners? What were the differences between the three in terms of ‘correspondence’ and ‘access type’? Given that I do not have a background in Educational Studies (or whatever the field is called), what are the definitions of ‘access type’, ‘correspondence’, ‘media type’ and ‘interaction type’? I am guessing that ‘correspondence’ and ‘interaction type’ is how instructors and learners communicate with each other, so what is the difference between the two?</p>
<p class="pad">On a slightly different note, I did appreciate that the authors listed the different scenarios they talked about. I also appreciated that they presented the survey results for those different scenarios… however, given how intimately the two were linked, I did not like have to jump from table 3 (the scenario description) to figure 6 (the survey results for the four scenarios). I would have liked to see all relevant information in a single box. But that’s limited to presentation.</p>
<p class="pad">In conclusion, while easy to read and initially promising, this paper did not really explain or discuss their results sufficiently.</p>
