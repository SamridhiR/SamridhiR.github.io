			<p>I am a <strong>biology</strong> and <strong>academic writing tutor</strong> for university students. I also work as a <strong>freelance reviewer</strong> and <strong>technical editor</strong>. </p>
			<p> As a tutor, I aim to teach students to think critically about their subject. It is imperative that students understand the concepts and how to apply it to various contexts. To encourage creative and critical thinking in students, I explain confusing concepts by making it relevant to them and ask relevant questions.</p>
			<p>In <strong>biology</strong>, my expertise is in:
				<ul class="circle">
				<li>Animal behavior</li>
				<li>Evolution</li>
				<li>Behavioral ecology</li>
				<li>Wetland ecology</li>
				<li>Mountain ecology</li>
				<li>Natural resources management</li>
				<li>Basic ecology statistics</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>As a <strong>writing tutor</strong>/<strong>reviewer</strong>/<strong>technical editor</strong>, I consider and provide feedback on:
				<ul class="circle">
				<li>Sentence structure</li>
				<li>Paragraph structure</li>
				<li>Grammatical issues</li>
				<li>Flow of arguments</li>
				<li>Flow of logic</li>

		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p class="section_ps">I once had a 10-minute 'what-conversation'.</p>
	</div>
</div>

		<div class="main">
			<p>When I was fifteen, I fell in love with a book– “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection” by Charles Darwin. Ever since then, biology, more specifically, the field of ‘ecology and evolution’ has been a passion. More recently, while pursuing my Master of Science degree (<a href="" title="why I spent years chasing after sheep">why I spent years chasing after bighorn sheep</a>) at the University of Calgary, I worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in multiple ecology courses. This ignited a second passion in me–teaching and learning. Now, I aim to merge the two passions together by working as a Tutor in Biology and Academic Writing for university students.</p>
			<p>The best bit of working as a TA (and now as a Writing Tutor) is that I get to give students feedback on their assignments and writing to improve their critical thinking and communication skills. I know that most students are very keen on improving because I’ve worked with them. Each semester, I kept track of student grades until the end of the semester… and overall, the quality of student assignment improved which was reflected in an increase in their grades, on average, by 15-25%! That’s at least an entire letter-grade improvement! Just based on my feedback and their hard work!</p>
			<p>That is why I enjoy teaching – it’s not just about me, it’s not just about you. It’s about the both of us, working collaboratively to ensure your success.</p>
			<p>It’s the same reason, I’ve always enjoyed reviewing and editing documents for my peers and colleagues. I enjoy working behind the scenes to help other people succeed. This means that my success is dependent on your success. If you want to work collaboratively, I’d love to hear from you! :D</p>
