		<h2>Hi, </h2>
		<div class="columns_home">
			<p>I am a biology and writing tutor for university students. I also work as a freelance reviewer and technical editor.</p> 
			<p>As a tutor, I aim to teach learners to think critically about their subject and their work. Learners can apply concepts only if they understand it. To encourage creative and critical thinking, I explain concepts by asking questions to determine their understanding and making the concepts relevant to them/their work.</p>
			<p>In <strong>biology</strong>, my expertise is in: </p>
			<ul class="circle">
				<li>Ecology</li>
				<li>Animal behavior</li>
				<li>Evolution</li>
				<li>Behavioral ecology</li>
				<li>Wetland ecology</li>
				<li>Mountain ecology</li>
				<li>Natural resource management</li>
				<li>Basic ecology statistics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a <strong>writing tutor/reviewer/technical editor</strong>, I consider and provide feedback on:</p>
			<ul class="circle">
				<li>Sentence structure</li>
				<li>Paragraph structure</li>
				<li>Grammar</li>
				<li>Flow of arguments/logic</li>
				<li>Strength of arguments/logic used</li>
				<li>Overall essay coherence</li>
				<li>In-text citations</li>
				<li>Reference list</li>
				<li>Making academic presentations</li>

		<h1 class="header_title">About Me</h1>
		<p class="header_title">I once had a 10-minute 'what-conversation'.</p></div></div>
	<div>
		<p>When I was fifteen, I fell in love with a book– “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection” by Charles Darwin. Since then, <em>ecology and evolution </em> has been a passion. While pursuing my second Masters’ degree, at the University of Calgary, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA). If you are interested in learning about my research (in brief), click the link: why I spent years following bighorn sheep. Working as a TA ignited a second passion–<em>teaching and learning</em>. Now, I aim to merge the two passions together by working as a Tutor in Biology and Academic Writing for university students.</p>
		<p>Most students are keen to improve their writing and critical thinking skills. I know this because I have graded and provided feedback on student assignments over several years. I kept track of student grades and found that, on average, by the end of each semester, the quality of student assignment improved by 15-25%. That is, at least, an entire letter-grade improvement! And it’s just based on my feedback—on their writing, logic and use of evidence—and their effort in addressing the feedback! More recently, as a writing tutor, I have been impressed with student desire to understand how to be better writers and dedication to self-improvement.</p>
		<p>And I… I like working behind the scenes to help other people learn, develop their thinking and be successful. This is, also, why I enjoy reviewing and editing other people’s work. It’s not just about my work; it’s not just about your work. It’s about the both of us working collaboratively to make a coherent whole.</p>
