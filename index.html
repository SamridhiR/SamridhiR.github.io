    <p>I am a biology and writing tutor for university students. I also work as a freelance reviewer and technical editor.</p> 
    <p>As a tutor, I aim to teach learners to think critically about their subject and their work. Learners can apply concepts only if they understand it. To encourage creative and critical thinking, I explain concepts by asking questions to determine their understanding and making the concepts relevant to them/their work.</p>
    <p>In <strong>biology</strong>, my expertise is in: </p>

      <li>Evolution</li>
      <li>Behavioral ecology</li>
      <li>Wetland and mountain ecology</li>
      <li>Natural resource management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a <strong>writing tutor/reviewer/technical editor</strong>, I consider and provide feedback on:</p>

		<p class="header_title">I once had a 10-minute 'what-conversation'.</p></div></div>
	<div class="pad">
		<p>When I was fifteen, I fell in love with a book–<em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em> by Charles Darwin. Since then, <em>ecology and evolution</em> has been a passion. After getting a bachelor's degree in biology and psychology from the US, I headed to Thailand for my first Masters' degree in Natural Resources Management. My field site was in Cambodia--a beautiful (but hot!) country (click the link: <a href="/assets/img/Rijal-Cochard2016_MimosaPigra.pdf" target="_blank" title="first Masters' research paper">prickly plant management</a> for my Masters' research paper).</p>
		<p>Then, I returned home to Nepal. For the next four years, I worked at national and international levels in various organizations--UNDP (in a project titled 'Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wetlands in Nepal' as a Program Officer), ICIMOD (International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development as a Junior Consultant) and the Ramsar Convention Secretariat in Switzerland (IUCN as the Assistant Advisor for Asia/Oceania). In these jobs, I enjoyed reviewing local and international field site assessments, community level management plans, project proposals and final project reports.</p>
		<p>When I went to the field site and talked to local community members and leaders, I realised the value of teaching ecology and conservation to young adults (and therefore, majority of the population in a few years). If they understand the impacts we have on the world, then we can work together to come up with solutions to mitigate the effects of our current trajectory (yes, climate change).</p>
		<p>And so began my journey to pursue a second Masters’ degree, at the University of Calgary. I taught university students as a Teaching Assistant (TA) while also collecting and analyzing data as a Graduate Researcher (<a href="/2020/09/09/research-overview-animal-behavior-and-parasites.html" target="_blank" title="Summary of my Masters' degree research at University of Calgary">why I spent years following bighorn sheep</a>). Working as a TA ignited a second passion–<em>teaching and learning</em>. Now, I aim to merge the two passions together.</p>
		<p>Most students are keen to improve their writing and critical thinking skills. I know this because I have graded and provided feedback on student assignments over several years. I kept track of student grades and found that, on average, by the end of each semester, the quality of student assignment improved by 15-25%. That is, at least, an entire letter-grade improvement! And it’s just based on my feedback—on their writing, logic and use of evidence—and their effort in addressing the feedback! More recently, as a writing tutor, I have been impressed with student desire to understand how to be better writers and dedication to self-improvement.</p>
		<p>And I… I like working behind the scenes to help other people learn, develop their thinking and be successful. This is, also, why I enjoy reviewing and editing other people’s work. It’s not just about my work; it’s not just about your work. It’s about the both of us working collaboratively to make a coherent whole.</p>
