<p class="pad">It was just a drizzle at first… but about two hours earlier, it had started raining in earnest. We had been hiking through Sheep River Provincial Park for the past six hours looking for any sign of sheep. It was late May and the rainwater was cold. <strong>The day was cold</strong>. I could feel the frigid water dripping down the ends of my purple waterproof jacket sleeves. I shivered as we walked between the trees wondering whether we should give up on the search for the day. </p>
<p class="pad">The squirrel people (researchers who studied squirrels) had it easy—when it rained, the squirrels went into their burrows and, so, the squirrel people went into their warm and dry lairs. But bighorn sheep are fighters—rain, snow, or the scorching heat, they’re out there in all weather conditions—and by necessity, so were we. On days like that one though, I liked to imagine that the rams were waiting for us, that they <em>wanted</em> us to find them and collect data about their behavior. I liked to imagine that if we did find them that day, they would miss us stalking their every move. </p>
<p class="pad">Besides, I tried to convince us, hiking was keeping us warm and really, what’re a few wet sleeves in the grand scheme of things? </p>
<p class="pad">Because, yes, the day was cold, wet, and miserable… But it was also an absolutely amazing time to get to know each other. As we hiked our way through the familiar trees and the dead logs that cold, wet day, my assistant, Camille*, and I talked. We talked about our beliefs about humanity, our ecological values, educational aspirations, and our short- and long-term goals. We got to know each other. It was a miserable day to be outside—the fact was indisputable—but it was also a beautiful day because we got to understand each other. </p>
<p class="pad">And, so, we persevered. We continued our search and our conversation for a couple of more hours. In the end, we didn’t come across any sheep that day, but we did appreciate being able to remove our damp (mostly wet by that time) clothing once we entered the warm trailer. (“What a glorious feeling, I’m happy again.”)</p>
<p class="pad">Ah (*happy sigh*), life in the field… makes one truly grasp the simple joys of life. </p>
