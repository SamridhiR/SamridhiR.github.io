<h3>Background information</h3>
<p class="pad">Social rank impacts the reproductive success of a male bighorn sheep because dominant males get more mating opportunities. This is because the females prefer to mate with more dominant males. So, male bighorn sheep determine their dominance hierarchy before the mating season begins in earnest.</p>
<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">In general, larger males tend to be more dominant compared to smaller males. However, slightly smaller but older males with more experience may be more dominant than slightly larger but younger males with no/little experience. As a result, the authors expected that mass and age of an individual determines their rank within the dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p class="pad">This paper shows that between the ages of 2-5, age and mass is a good predictor of a ram’s social rank within the dominance hierarchy—a three-year old ram is always larger (and therefore more dominant) than a one-year old. However, as rams get older and reach their asymptotic mass (at around age 6), age is no longer a good predictor and instead, mass is the main predictor of social rank.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">My masters’ research was around parasites, so even though this paper doesn’t really mention parasites, it was on my mind. Establishing dominance hierarchy can be energetically expensive and can lead to high levels of stress in individuals, especially if the individual has to re-establish their social rank repeatedly. On the other hand, if establishing your spot on the dominance hierarchy is, at least, semi-permanent, then it might lead to an overall decreased stress on the dominant individuals. So, why am I talking about energy expenses and stress? Because, when an individual is stressed and in engaged in energetically expensive activity, that individual may be more susceptible to infections. I’m sure you’ve noticed that you tend to fall sick after a major stressful event, especially, if it comes at the end of a few months of stress, for example, falling sick after sitting for final exams is a very common phenomenon. It’s also common to fall sick if you travel the day after the semester ends.</p>
<p class="pad">But I digress. This research got me wondering whether parasite infection intensity was related to the individual’s position in the dominance hierarchy. If yes, what was the relationship? Was the relationship stronger when individuals were growing up (age 2-5) and frequently challenging each other or; was the correlation between parasite infection intensity and dominance hierarchy stronger when individuals were older? Were all males in the bachelor group more stressed (and more susceptible) during the pre-rut?</p>
