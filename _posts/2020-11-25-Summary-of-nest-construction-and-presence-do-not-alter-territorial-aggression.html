<h3>Background</h3>
<p class="pad">When a resident male builds a nest within his territory, his chances of mating increases. Threespine stickleback fish use their nests only to mate in it—they do not live in their nests. Thus, if male threespine stickleback fish who have built nests in their territory are more aggressive towards intruder males, the nests are the reason for the increased aggression.</p>
<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">The researchers captured 90 male threespined stickleback fish in California. These males were moved to visually isolated tanks for 24 hours to get them used to their new homes (i.e., acclimation period) before the study started. These were the resident males. On Day 1 (after the 24 hours acclimation period), the researchers introduced an intruder male to the tank. The resident males were given five minutes to notice the intruder male. If the resident male did not notice the intruder within the five minutes, the trial ended with no interactions. However, if the resident male noticed the intruder, then, the researchers recorded the interaction between the resident and intruder males for five minutes. The types of interactions that the researchers recoded were the number of times the resident male adjusted their position in relation to the intruder, the time of first bite, the number of bites and the number of changes towards the intruder. </p>
<p class="pad">After this first trial, the researchers added algae and a sand-filled nesting box so that the resident males could build their nesting site. Forty-eights hours later (Day 3), when the stickleback males were in the middle of building their nest, the researchers started the second trial. Again, they followed the same procedure in recording the interactions between the resident and intruder males. Trial 3 took place on Day 5, when the males had completed building their nest. </p>

<p class="pad">Males who started biting earlier into the trial session, bit more times overall. On average, resident males noticed an intruder within a minute. After noticing the intruder, resident males took between 90 seconds (one and half minutes) to 150 seconds (two and half minutes) to bite the intruder for the first time. Resident males who built a nest were as aggressive as resident males who did not build a nest between the trails. Additionally, there was no change in a male’s aggressiveness before and after completing a nest (for those who did build a complete nest). Furthermore, resident males who completed building their nest were the same size as males who did not build a nest.</p>
<p class="pad">Although some resident males started building the nest immediately and others took longer to build the nest, all resident males were more-or-less equally aggressive towards the intruder male. Additionally, individuals who were more aggressive in Trial 1 were consistently more aggressive in all Trials. That is, aggressive behavior displays within individuals remained consistent throughout the experiment.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">Compared to some of the other articles that I have summarized, there was a lot more details in this one that I thought was important to include. In my senior year of bachelor’s degree, I conducted a similar research with convict cichlid fish. By similar, I mean that I was investigating whether the presence of a potential mating nest would add value to their ‘territory’ and therefore, increase resident male’s aggressive behavior towards the intruder (because they may have more to lose). I used convict cichlid fish, had resident and intruder males and placed smaller resident males against larger intruder males. I deliberately pit smaller resident males against larger intruder males to see whether the resource-value hypothesis would ‘win’ against the holding potential hypothesis. In my research, the holding potential hypothesis ‘won’. That is, larger males seemed more likely to take over the nest.</p>
<p class="pad">As the researchers pointed out, I did notice a similar consistent individual difference in resident and intruder males. However, I was not expecting it and so failed to collect data about it. I was very pleased to read that they did not make the same mistake. I really enjoyed reading this paper. I do not know if it is my background bias, but I found it easy to read and follow… except for specific bits about the methodology.</p>
<p class="pad">I’m still not sure if Day 0 was straight after they collected the fish from the Creek because they placed the fish directly into isolated tank, or whether the fish had a few days to get used to a tank-life, before they were moved into separate isolated tanks (Day 0). Additionally, I couldn’t make out whether the intruder males had their own separate isolated tanks (and therefore already had a territory), or whether the intruder males were living in a communal tank (shared with other males and so they might not have had a claimed territory). I am not sure whether the intruder male arrangement would make an impact on their aggressiveness, but if the intruder males had their own territory, then they might be less invested in fighting the resident male over his territory.</p>
<p class="pad">Of course, the researchers made it clear that they were mostly interested in the resident males’ side of the story because the intruder males were confined to a glass flask; there was no way that the two would, in reality, compete for the territory. It was just a set-up to test resident male aggressiveness over nests. I get that. It was a good paper that had a specific question and it delivered. And like all good research articles, it raised some follow-up questions. I enjoyed reading it. </p>
