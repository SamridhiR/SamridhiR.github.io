<h3>Background information before the article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">Males and females of many species are different from one another. These differences can be morphological (based on structure, for example, male mammals tend to be larger than female mammals), physiological (based on hormones, for example, males have higher concentrations of testosterone while females have higher concentrations of oestrogen), and behavioral (based on behaviour, for example, males and females of the same species can have different foraging patterns, dispersal behaviors and others).</p>
<p>Parasite prevalence refers to the percentage of the host population that is infected with a parasite.</p>
<p>Parasite intensity refers to the mean number of parasites (of a species/type) in an infected host.</p>
<p>Host-parasite systems refers to the system that links a parasite population with a host population.</p>
<p>Most host species have more than one parasite. </p>
<h3>Article summary</h3>
<p class="pad">Differences between males and females could lead to a slight but consistent difference in parasite infection prevalence or intensity. Using data from 85 published articles, the author investigated infection prevalence and intensity in multiple host-parasite systems.</p>
<p class="pad">Parasite prevalence was higher in males compared to parasite prevalence in females of the same species. This pattern was strongest when the hosts were birds (male-biased parasitism was seen in 63 host-parasite systems, compared to female-biased parasitism seen in 25 systems) or mammals (male-biased parasitism was seen in 64 host-parasite systems, compared to female-biased parasitism seen in 41 systems). The author did not find any clear sex-bias in parasite intensity when all taxa and species in the studies were considered together; however, male mammals had a significantly higher infection intensity compared to female mammals.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p class="pad">This article is well written and easy to understand. It was a great starting point. In fact, this is the article that sparked my interest in investigating host-sex bias in bighorn sheep. Initially, because bighorn sheep are mammals, I thought that it might be as simple as, ‘oh hey, parasite prevalence is always higher in males.’ But, after thinking about it a bit more, I wondered whether these 85 papers had studied populations at around the same time in their life histories. In other words, were males more vulnerable to parasite infections throughout the year and/or their lives, or were the studies conducted when males were more vulnerable? Are there times of the year when females may be more vulnerable and, therefore, have a higher parasite prevalence, for example, during pregnancy and/or birthing season?</p>
<p class="pad">With those sorts of questions in mind, I read a lot of articles trying to determine how long the studies lasted (a few months, a year, or over a year) to figure out whether parasite prevalence and intensity was higher in males throughout their lives or whether parasite prevalence in females was higher for some species/at some points in the females’ lives.</p>
