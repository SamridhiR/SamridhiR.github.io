<p class="pad">In 2019, I participated in the SAGES program.  <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/science/sages-program/" target="_blank" title="link to the official SAGES webpage at the University of Calgary">SAGES</a>*, an acronym with two other acronyms within it, is a program at the University of Calgary that teaches graduate students how to be a more responsive educator. In the first semester, we learned some theoretical concepts behind teaching and learning. We also learned how to provide feedback; align learning outcomes and assignments; set learning objectives; actively engage students in their learning process; and the basics of how memory and learning works.</p>
<p class="pad">In the second semester, we had to put what we had learned into practice. For the practicum, I developed a tutorial for the Conservation Biology course. In the previous year, I had worked as a TA for this course, and had identified a specific tutorial topic—hunting—that no one wanted to discuss. Most students were against hunting. Discussions around this topic were very flat—any ‘rebellion’ against the popular idea of ‘hunting bad’ was quickly squashed. I was, quite frankly, appalled that the students against hunting were not even interested in having a discussion. It seemed like their thinking was limited to ‘killing is bad, therefore hunting is bad.’</p>
<p class="pad"> I wanted to broaden students’ perspectives and provide them with information about hunting from different perspectives so that students considered the biological, social, economic and political aspects of the topic and how it ties to conservation efforts. Only then, in my opinion, could they form an educated view. </p>
<p class="pad">	My aim for the redesigned tutorial was to provide different perspectives on the topic (the full poster is below). During the tutorial session, students were randomly sorted into two groups – for or against hunting – and they had to debate the topic for their group. Astonishingly, for me at least, a substantial percentage of the class changed their minds about hunting after the in-class debate! And it went both ways – students who had previously been against hunting, were now more accepting of it, while students who had previously been for hunting, were now against it. Although, more students became more accepting of hunting. And I’m saying ‘more accepting’ because they still didn’t actively support it, but they understood the positive impacts that good hunting practices could have on conservation efforts. It was a conditional acceptance, not an unconditional approval.</p>
<p class="pad">	Overall, students appeared to appreciate the complex nature of the issue under discussion and understand the importance of critical thinking and meaningful discussions. In the end, students learned the value of considering different perspectives when making decisions.</p>
