<p class="pad">Welcome! This post provides some background information and elaborates on my motivations. As you could see under the ‘musings’ header on the main page, this blog is divided (or, will be when I add more posts to it) into three categories—ecology and evolution, higher education and personal.</p>
<p class="pad">Each new piece of writing (post) that I upload will fall under, at least, one of these three categories. For example, I am a recent MSc graduate specializing in Ecology. When I talk about my research, it may fall under ‘ecology and evolution’ and ‘personal’. During this time, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant and so, when I reflect on those experiences, the article may fall under ‘higher education’ and ‘personal’. But, if I post an article about my experiences living in Nepal, Thailand, Canada or any of the other countries that I’ve lived in or visited, then, those will only be ‘personal’.</p>
<p class="pad">For most posts under ‘ecology and evolution’ and ‘higher education’ categories, I will summarise a journal article and reflect on it. I will use a formal and professional tone in these articles. Posts under ‘personal’ will be reflections on my experiences. These articles will be more friendly, and so I will use a casual tone.</p>
<p class="pad">My main motivation for starting this blog is to share the ideas in articles with anyone and everyone who has an internet connection and a budding interest in these topics.</p>
